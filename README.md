# Nvim Plugin Tutorial

# 1. Introduction
A learning experience to attempt to replicate a simple lua plugin for `neovim`. The tutorial and
the great work/explanation can be found [here](https://dev.to/2nit/how-to-write-neovim-plugins-in-lua-5cca)!

This is practically a direct rewrite from the mentioned project above with the intent to:
1. understand how a simple plugin could work
2. visualize a practical example of the use of the `nvim` API
3. practice a bit of lua within an environment it can be fully applied to
